# P3 - Blockchain and Merkle Tree Implementation

This project represents a sophisticated and professional implementation of Blockchain and Merkle Tree data structures, meticulously designed in Java. It is engineered to efficiently read transactions from a designated file, strategically add them to a priority queue based on predefined criteria, and subsequently incorporate them into a robust blockchain.

Each block within the blockchain is ingeniously represented as a Merkle Tree, a testament to the projectâ€™s commitment to data integrity and security. This design choice not only enhances the overall performance but also provides a reliable and secure method for verification and validation of transactions within each block.
